## 🛠️ Usage Instructions

1.  **Download:** Click the link above to download the executable file.
2.  **Run:** Double-click `NozzleCalc.exe`. Windows might ask for permission since it's a new engineering tool; allow it to run.
3.  **Input Data:** Enter your motor/engine parameters in the sidebar (Throat Radius, Chamber Pressure, Exhaust Pressure, etc.).
4.  **Compute:** Press `ENTER` or click "COMPUTE GEOMETRY".
5.  **Analyze:**
    * Use the **2D Visualization** tab to inspect the geometry. Hover over the graph to see coordinates.
    * Use the **Technical Data** tab for precise numerical outputs (Lengths, Expansion Ratios, Angles).
6.  **Save:** Use the toolbar at the top to Save (`Ctrl+S` equivalent) your project for later use.
